Welcome!

SaveStuff (better name may come in the future) is a simple file format and parser.

An example of the file format can be found in testin.svstf.

I recommend the file extension "svstf" for files using SaveStuff, but obviously any extension can be used.

Currently, the only build system I officially support is Ubuntu (specifically 16.04), but it should be possible to build this library on any decent operating system without modification to the code itself.

To build the demo, run "make demo"

To test the demo, run "make test" or ./savestuff

To run the demo with gdb, run "make debug" or gdb savestuff

To build a shared library (libsavestuff.so), run "make"

SaveStuff is licensed under MIT, so you're welcome to integrate this into your projects or to fork/expand the library.

SaveStuff uses boost::variant, so that portion of the library is licensed under the Boost license. In the future, I may get rid of the dependency of Boost.

There is no formal documentation yet, but the header file (variable.hpp) combined with the demo (demo.cpp) should be sufficiently documented to determine what to do.
